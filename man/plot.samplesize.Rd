\title{Calculating the EVSI for a specific WTP giving the uncertainty bands across the different
samples sizes}
\usage{
\method{plot}{samplesize}(evsi, wtp = NULL, pos = c("bottomright"),
  CI = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{evsi}{Output of the comp.evsi.N function}

\item{wtp}{The willingness to pay value that the graphic should be produced for - it will
be chosen if wtp=NULL.}

\item{pos}{The position where the legend will be printed (default='bottomright')}

\item{CI}{The indexes that we would like to take from the CI in the evsi object.}
}
\value{
EVSI The EVSI calculated for a specific wtp with uncertainty estimates.

A graphical representation of the uncertainty.
