Time Horizons for the treatment and incidence population}
\usage{
\method{plot}{prob.ce}(evsi, trial.cost = NULL, setup = NULL,
  pp = NULL, Pop = c(0, 10000), Time = c(1, 20), Dis = 0.035,
  wtp = NULL, N = NULL, pos = c("topright"))
}
\arguments{
\item{evsi}{An evsi object.}

\item{trial.cost}{Either a fixed trial cost (numeric),a minimum and maximum value for the possible trial costs
(numeric) or a distribution for a trial cost (character string) - to give probability of cost-effectiveness
for the trial. Can be NULL if setup and pp are both given (and N if the sample size is not specified when
the EVSI has been calculated/uploaded).}

\item{setup}{Gives the setup costs of the trial. Can be NULL if trial.costs are given. If NULL and pp given
setup is taken to be 0.}

\item{pp}{Gives the per person costs of the trial. Can be NULL if trial.costs are given.}

\item{Pop}{The minimum and maximum possible values for the number of people benefitting from
the treatment}

\item{Time}{The minimum and maximum possible values for the time horizon of the treatment.}

\item{Dis}{The discount rate for future studies, based on NICE guidelines.}

\item{wtp}{The willingness to pay value that this analysis is being undetaken for.
If NULL then the function will automatically select the central wtp to default in BCEA will be 25000}

\item{N}{The sample size which we want to consider for the trial. If NULL then taken as the median trial size
considered.}

\item{pos}{The position where the legend will be printed in the resulting graph.}
}
\value{
A graphic that gives the probability of a cost-effective trial.
